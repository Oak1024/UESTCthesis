This paper design a RTOS-based intelligent USB adapter. Use RT-Thread as the software platform, two STM32 MCU as the hardware platform. through a DIY grammar interpreter, the user can always write your own internal documents interpreted as a keyboard filter, thus achieving change keyboard keys, keyboard macros, macro recording and other functions, and thus enhance the user's ability to control the keyboard, you can easily implement complex keyboard. This system can be seen as a hardware implementation of windows application "QuickMacro".
